*Bindery.js* is a library for designing printable books with <span class="sc">html</span> and <span class="sc">css</span>.

At its simplest, Bindery splits content over multiple pages. It allows the designer to create numbers, running headers, spreads, footnotes, tables of contents, indexes, and more based on that flow of content. It also supports print options like bleed, crop marks, and booklet ordering.

Bindery is intended to let web designers think about book design as an extension of the responsive web, and let print designers express sophisticated book layouts programmatically, without opening InDesign.
